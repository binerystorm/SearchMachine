# Description
This is my attempt at making a search machine C(++), with no dependencies. The project is nowhere near finished. So using it is something which should only be done at the risk of your own exasperation. 

# Usage 
The project can be built with the following command:
```
$ mkdir build
$ ./build.sh
```
And it can be run with:
```
$ build/build
```
